To run this project, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1.Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.Navigate to the project folder and run npm install to install the dependencies.
3.Create a Firebase project and enable email and password authentication. Copy the Firebase configuration object and paste it in the public/js/firebase.js file.
4.Run node server.js to start the server.
5.Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the app.

Usage
To use this app, you need to create an account or log in with an existing one. You will also need to verify your email address by clicking on the link sent to your inbox. If you forget your password, you can reset it by clicking on the “Forgot password?” link on the login page.

Once logged in, you can see your name and profile picture on the top right corner of the page. You can also sign out from there.

On the main page, you can interact with various fun elements by clicking on them. Some of them will display a gif, some of them will play a voice, some of them will do nothing.

To use the calculator, click on the “Calculator” button on the top right corner of the page. You will see a simple calculator interface where you can enter numbers and operators and see the result.

To play tic tac toe, click on the “Tic Tac Toe” button on the bottom right corner of the page. You will be redirected to a new page where you can choose to play with another user .

The tic tac toe game is played on a 3x3 grid. You can make your move by clicking on an empty cell. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. You can see your score and your opponent’s score on the top of the page.

Future Plans
I aim to make more games and random fun recreational activities in this app in the future. Some of the ideas I have are:

•Rock paper scissors game
•Hangman game
•Trivia quiz
•Joke generator
•Meme generator
